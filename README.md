# SookieCoin

Setting up a ERC20 smart contract SookieCoin using Remix IDE &amp; OpenZeppelin

## Context

This is entirely a work in progress. I was looking for inspiration as to how to create a cryptocoin based on the ETH blockchain. 

The initial idea was to create it based on XRP, but it seems ETH has been heavily documented and this project is a result of testing out how it might turn out. Using Remix IDE and the following videos:

### Goal

Here's what SookieCoin would ideally stand for:

- Stand for a combination of financial empowerment and compassionate principles
- Core values would include growing wealth while contributing to a greater cause - supporting dog adoption and shelter initiatives
- Every transaction of SookieCoin would generate a small 2% small fee directed toward a wallet dedicated to funding dog shelters, medical care, adoption initiatives. It's a purpse-driven coin, making every transaction meaningful.
- Fixed supply of 10 million coins, driving up demand over time.
- Funds directed to dog shelters are trackable on the blockchain, ensuring contributions can be verified.
